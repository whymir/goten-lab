All level plausible Cookie Manipulation Payload Example

Identify the Vulnerable Input Field

The application uses a cookie (e.g., auth_token=admin) to determine user access level without validating or signing it.
Cookie: auth_token=user

Some application uses a Base64-encoded cookie value to store role or session information.
Cookie: auth_token=dXNlcg==
echo dXNlcg== | base64
# Output: user

Beside basic Base64 encryption, there are some method that may be used during the cookie creation such as:
JWT
Signed JWT
HMAC128
HMAC256
