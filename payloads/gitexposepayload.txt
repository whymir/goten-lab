.git expose

If you discover the .git directory exposed in a browsable location, it's critical to take immediate action. Exposing .git grants attackers access to source code, risking vulnerability exploitation. Secure the directory to prevent unauthorized access and conduct a comprehensive review to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities.

To address this issue, utilize tools like GitTools:

- Clone the GitTools repository:
git clone https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper.git

- Navigate to the Dumper directory:
cd git-dumper

- Install tools requirement
pip install -r requirement.txt

- Execute the script to dump the .git contents:
python3 git_dumper.py http://target/.git/ dest-dir

- Change directory to the destination folder:
cd dest-dir

- Check out the source code:
ls


This process allows you to access and review the source code obtained from the exposed .git directory. Be sure to investigate thoroughly and address any identified security concerns promptly.
