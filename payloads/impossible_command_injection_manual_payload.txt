-- Sanitization of Input
The code uses stripslashes() to remove any slashes from the user input. This helps prevent injection attacks that rely on escaping characters.

-- Validation of IP Address
The code validates the user input to ensure that it consists of four numeric octets separated by dots. This ensures that the input is in the correct format for an IP address and prevents injection of arbitrary commands.

-- Use of shell_exec() Safely
The code uses shell_exec() to execute the ping command. However, it constructs the command in a safe manner by directly concatenating the input with the command string. There is no opportunity for an attacker to inject additional commands.

-- Platform-Specific Command Execution
Depending on the operating system (Windows or Linux), the code executes different ping commands. This prevents attackers from crafting platform-specific payloads that may work on one platform but fail on the other.

-- Output Display
The code properly displays the command used for ping and the resulting output in separate HTML elements (<code> and <pre>). This ensures that any potentially malicious output is not executed as HTML or JavaScript code.

In summary, the combination of input validation, proper use of shell_exec(), and platform-specific command execution makes it impossible to achieve OS command injection from this code.
